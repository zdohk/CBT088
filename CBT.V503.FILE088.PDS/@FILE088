//*   AUTO  -  Automatic command and job scheduler.  This code      *   FILE 088
//*            was originaly on the CBT tape many years ago, but    *   FILE 088
//*            stopped working when MVS/ESA V5 came out because     *   FILE 088
//*            of some new ways of doing things with that version   *   FILE 088
//*            of MVS.  This program allows you to schedule jobs    *   FILE 088
//*            or commands to run at any time of day, any day of    *   FILE 088
//*            week any month of (well you get the picture).  It    *   FILE 088
//*            runs as a started task (time=1440) and you can use   *   FILE 088
//*            it to automatically schedule anything.  You can      *   FILE 088
//*            also fire off anything in it's files (by time or     *   FILE 088
//*            jobname) at any time.  There are 2 datasets that     *   FILE 088
//*            you will need to create, in the code they are        *   FILE 088
//*            SYZYGY.AUTO.COMMANDS and SYZYGY.AUTO.JOBS, (you      *   FILE 088
//*            should probably rename those) and the directions     *   FILE 088
//*            are easy to follow and are located in the first      *   FILE 088
//*            few hundred lines of hte code. We have used this     *   FILE 088
//*            as our ONLY scheduling system for years, and when    *   FILE 088
//*            we go to customer sites for contracts, we normally   *   FILE 088
//*            set it up for our stuff and the customer typically   *   FILE 088
//*            moves over to using it before we leave.  It's very   *   FILE 088
//*            easy to use and uses no resources.  You can give     *   FILE 088
//*            it a very high priority, (and probably should), we   *   FILE 088
//*            have thousands of jobs and commands scheduled with   *   FILE 088
//*            this guy every day, and it typically uses less       *   FILE 088
//*            than 1 minute (between 25 and 45 sec) of CPU time    *   FILE 088
//*            per month, (We IPL once per month wheather we need   *   FILE 088
//*            to or not). You can concatonate command and/or job   *   FILE 088
//*            libraries as needed so that you can have             *   FILE 088
//*            production and test jobs.  You can run as many       *   FILE 088
//*            copies of this little address space as you want      *   FILE 088
//*            for different purposes (test and production), but    *   FILE 088
//*            don't forget to use different command libraries      *   FILE 088
//*            because you will end up doing everything multiple    *   FILE 088
//*            times if you don't remember.                         *   FILE 088

//*   COMMANDZ  -  This program was originally copied from          *   FILE 088
//*           the CBT tape and was originally written by John V.    *   FILE 088
//*           Hooper to execute a stack of commands to automate     *   FILE 088
//*           processing.  I have added a slew of code to this      *   FILE 088
//*           program so that now you can use it for scheduling     *   FILE 088
//*           and also I have included IF/Then logic parameters.    *   FILE 088
//*           The added code allows the following functions:        *   FILE 088

//*           to keep from sending those to syslog and we have      *   FILE 088
//*           saved ourseleves a lot of time and it make looking    *   FILE 088
//*           for problems easier because you don't have to         *   FILE 088

//*   REDMSG  -  This program was also originally from the CBT      *   FILE 088

//*   SLSUX06 -  Storage Tek Silo Exit 6.  This code has also been  *   FILE 088
//*           given to STK as of 1/99 and will be distributed by    *   FILE 088
//*           them, but since I wrote it, I wanted to put it here   *   FILE 088
//*           as well.  This exit gets invoked on cartridge         *   FILE 088
//*           insert/eject processing.  We had a problem whereby    *   FILE 088
//*           when the operators printed the CA-1 scratch pick      *   FILE 088
//*           list, they didn't know which tapes were already in    *   FILE 088
//*           the silo and which ones were outside (and available   *   FILE 088
//*           to be picked).  This exit was already being used to   *   FILE 088
//*           flag tapes as scratch as soon as they were entered,   *   FILE 088
//*           (the one that STK has in their book and on the        *   FILE 088
//*           sample tapes does not work), so I changed it so that  *   FILE 088
//*           the tapes are now flagged as in or out of the silo.   *   FILE 088
//*           I had a talk with Computer Associates and they were   *   FILE 088
//*           nice enough to designate a flag which shows in or     *   FILE 088
//*           out of the silo, you can even show which silo it's    *   FILE 088
//*           in, (if you have more than 1) with this code.  It     *   FILE 088
//*           allows a lot of flexibility and has saved us the      *   FILE 088
//*           cost of a lot of operator overtime.  They also get    *   FILE 088
//*           less upset about who has to pick tapes now!           *   FILE 088
//*                                                                 *   FILE 088
